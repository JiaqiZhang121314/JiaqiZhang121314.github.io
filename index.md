# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Jiaqi Zhang and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is your_major.

### CPSC 120
* Lab 4
    Lab 4, part 1 is one of my very favorite labs because it taught me how to
    convert volume measurements from milliliters in the metric system to
    various units in the U.S. customary system. This is very common and useful
    in our daily life. This experiment made me realize that code is very
    powerful and precise. Learning code well can help us solve many real-life
    problems.
* Lab 5
    I really like Lab 5, part 1 because I think solving math problems by writing
    code is a very smart choice. Although we are currently simply calculating 
    the area of ​​a rectangle, this is just a start. In the future, we will face 
    more complex mathematical problems that are far more difficult than simple
    calculations of the area of ​​a rectangle. After learning to program, we will
    be able to solve these problems more easily.
* Lab 7 
    Lab 7 is also one of my favorite experiments because it makes me realize that
    code can be connected to real life. In this experiment, I learned how to use
    functions to describe parking rules. This made me deeply appreciate the power
    of functions, which can simplify complex problems into a few lines of code. I
    believe that in the future we can build on this experiment and develop a
    complete and widely applicable parking ticket app.
